# GamesAPI
### A Web scrapping Node.js RESTful API for delivering video games data.
#### With the use of libraries like Axios and Cheerio, the API fetches different web pages, scraps data and delivers it through various endpoints.<br/>
*For now, the API does not require an API key, but will in the future.
